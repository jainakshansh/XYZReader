# Google Udacity India Scholars 2018 - Android Developer Nanodegree Project 5

## XYZ Reader - Making the App Material project.
In this project, I updated the look and feel of the application to meet the Material Design guidelines.


### Why this Project?
This project gives me an opportunity to improve an app's design, a vital skill for building apps that users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

### What will this teach me?
1. Understanding the fundamentals of Android design.
2. Applying Material Design guidelines to a mobile application.
3. Seperating an interface into surfaces.
4. Effectively using motion and transitions.
